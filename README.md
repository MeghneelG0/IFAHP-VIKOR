# ifahp_vikor_SRPM
A Software Requirement Prioritization Model using the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (IF-AHP) and VIKOR method. 

This model captures uncertainty in decision-makers' and experts' input, as software requirements are inherently uncertain. The VIKOR method is used for compromise ranking, ensuring that the best possible ranking is determined for decision-making.

This module is particularly useful in Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs), including Agile, Incremental, and other iterative methodologies.

 Features

Flexible Input Handling: Accepts any number of alternatives and criteria.

IF-AHP Crisp Score Computation: Converts fuzzy preference relations into numerical values.

VIKOR Method Integration: Computes Q-values to rank alternatives.

Modular & Scalable: Designed as a reusable Python module.
